# Labyrinth

This repository was made as a labyrinth demo using textures and physics, with a score counter: https://jesusgarciavaladez.github.io/labyrinth/.

# Instructions

You can move around using the arrow keys or the `wasd` keys. The view can be controlled using the mouse. It's highly recommended to see this demo on a computer and click on the scene before starting the game.

# How to win

You only have to see the spheres with the cursor, and the score counter will decrease automatically.
